Final Year Project (Neuroevolutionary Agents)

Description:

“Artificial Life is the study of man-made systems that exhibit behaviors characteristic of natural living systems. It complements the traditional biological sciences concerned with the analysis of living organisms by attempting to synthesize life-like behaviors within computers and other artificial media. By extending the empirical foundation upon which biology is based beyond the carbon-chain life that has evolved on Earth, Artificial Life can contribute to theoretical biology by locating life-as-we-know-it within the larger picture of life-as-it-could-be.” Christopher Langton (1989), "Artificial Life" In: Langton ed. Artificial Life. Addison-Wesley. p. 1 One of the most exciting avenues for the study of Artificial Life and Evolutionary Robotics is that of Neuroevolution - the combination of Evolutionary Computation and Neural Networks. There are numerous approaches to implementing Neuroevolution, and countless domains in which Neuroevolution has proven to be fruitful. This project would involve the creation of an artificial life world populated with simulated artificial agents employing neuroevolution with the objective of synthesizing life-like and adaptive behaviours."
